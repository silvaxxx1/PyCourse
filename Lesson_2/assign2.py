# Assignment: Tip Calculator

# **Objective:**
# Create a Tip Calculator that calculates the tip, total bill, and the amount per person (if the bill is split).

# **Instructions:**

# 1. **Get the information from the user:**
#    - Ask the user to input the total bill amount.
#    - Ask the user to input the tip percentage.
#    - Ask if they want to split the bill. If yes, ask how many people are splitting it.

# 2. **Calculate the Tip:**
#    - Calculate the tip as (bill_amount * tip_percentage) / 100.

# 3. **Calculate the Total Bill:**
#    - Add the tip to the bill amount.

# 4. **Split the Bill (if necessary):**
#    - If the user wants to split the bill, divide the total by the number of people.

# 5. **Display the Results:**
#    - Output the tip, total bill, and (if applicable) the amount each person has to pay.

# **Example Input:**
#    - Bill amount: 100
#    - Tip percentage: 15
#    - Split bill: Yes
#    - Number of people: 4

# **Example Output:**
#    "The tip is 15.0, and the total bill is 115.0. Each person should pay 28.75."
