# Assignment: BMI Calculator

# **Objective:**
# Create a BMI calculator that takes user input, calculates the BMI, 
# classifies it into categories, and displays the result in a friendly format.

# **Instructions:**
# 1. **Get User Data:**
#    - Prompt the user to input their name.
#    - Ask for the user's age.
#    - Ask for the user's height (in meters).
#    - Ask for the user's weight (in kilograms).

# 2. **Calculate BMI:**
#    - Use the formula to calculate BMI:
#      BMI = weight / (height^2)
#    - Round the BMI to two decimal places.

# 3. **Classify BMI:**
#    - Classify the BMI based on the following:
#      - BMI < 18.5: "Underweight"
#      - 18.5 <= BMI < 24.9: "Normal weight"
#      - 25 <= BMI < 29.9: "Overweight"
#      - BMI >= 30: "Obese"

# 4. **Output the Result:**
#    - Output a message that says:
#      "Hi, [Name]! Your BMI is [BMI]. You are classified as [Category]."

# **Program Structure:**
# - Use functions for each major task:
#   1. A function to get user data (name, age, height, weight).
#   2. A function to calculate the BMI.
#   3. A function to classify the BMI based on its value.
#   4. A function to display the result.
# - You can use simple if-else conditions for classification.
# - The program should be modular and well-organized.

# **Example Input:**
#    - Name: Alice
#    - Age: 30
#    - Height: 1.70 meters
#    - Weight: 60 kg

# **Example Output:**
#    "Hi, Alice! Your BMI is 20.76. You are classified as Normal weight."

# Now, go ahead and write the program!
