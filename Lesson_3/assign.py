# Assignment: Implement a Simple Calculator using 'match' Statements

# Objective: Modify the calculator program to use Python's 'match' statement 
# for performing operations based on the operator entered by the user.

# Steps:
# 1. Write a function `calculator()` that:
#    - Accepts two numbers from the user.
#    - Accepts an operator character (e.g., '+', '-', '*', '/') from the user.
#    - Uses a `match` statement to execute the corresponding operation based on the operator.
#    - Returns the result of the operation or an error message if the operator is invalid.
# 
# 2. The `match` statement should have the following structure:
#    - Match the operator and perform the corresponding operation:
#        - '+' : Addition
#        - '-' : Subtraction
#        - '*' : Multiplication
#        - '/' : Division (Handle division by zero with an appropriate error message)
#    - If the operator is not recognized, print an error message.
# 

# 3. Ensure that the program handles invalid inputs gracefully, such as:
#    - Non-numeric inputs for numbers
#    - Invalid operator characters
#
# 4. Test the program with various inputs to ensure it works correctly.
# 5. Add comments to explain the code and its functionality.
# 6. Use meaningful variable names and maintain code readability.
# 7. Ensure the program is user-friendly and provides clear instructions.
