# Assignment: BMI Calculator using Conditionals and Functions

# Instructions:
# 1. Create a program that calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input for weight (in kg) and height (in meters).
# 2. The formula for BMI is: BMI = weight (kg) / height (m)^2.
# 3. Write a function `calculate_bmi(weight, height)` to compute BMI.
# 4. Write a function `bmi_category(bmi)` to categorize the BMI into the following categories:
#    - "Underweight" for BMI less than 18.5
#    - "Normal weight" for BMI between 18.5 and 24.9
#    - "Overweight" for BMI between 25 and 29.9
#    - "Obesity" for BMI 30 or greater
# 5. Based on the BMI category, print a health tip:
#    - "Underweight": Suggest gaining weight by eating a balanced diet and exercising.
#    - "Normal weight": Encourage maintaining a healthy lifestyle.
#    - "Overweight": Suggest adopting a healthier diet and exercising regularly.
#    - "Obesity": Recommend consulting a healthcare provider for personalized advice.
# 6. Ensure the program only runs when executed directly (use `if __name__ == "__main__":`).
# 7. Output should include the calculated BMI, the health category, and the health tip.

# Example Output:
# Enter your weight in kilograms: 75
# Enter your height in meters: 1.75
# Your BMI is: 24.49
# You are in the 'Normal weight' category.
# Tip: Keep up the good work with a healthy lifestyle!
